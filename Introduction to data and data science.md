It consists of 6 core lessons:

Introduction to Data, Data science and Python Programming Basics
Python for Data Science
Mathematics for Data Science
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Inferential Statistics
Machine Learning

üéØ Focus Objectives
Our goal is to make learning fun, practical, and directly applicable to solving real-world problems and driving innovative solutions.

## üñ•Ô∏è Lesson 1

The foundation of any career begins the moment one decides, ‚ÄúThis is what I want to be.‚Äù
Starting a career journey like this is most powerful when you know both your starting point and destination. Data science is an ever-evolving field, especially with the massive amount of data generated daily.

### üéì Learning Outcomes
At the end of this lesson, we will have:

- Gained foundational knowledge of the data science process (data collection, cleaning, analysis, and modeling).

- Explored career opportunities in data science.

- Understood Python programming elements like variables, data types, operators, control structures, and functions.

- Developed problem-solving skills through hands-on activities.

- Practiced object-oriented programming, modules, exception handling, regular expressions, and basic database interactions.

## Introduction to Data & Data Science

### What is Data?üåü
Imagine it‚Äôs Friday afternoon and you walk into a bank to:
    - Withdraw #50,000
    - At 08:21 AM
    - Using an ATM 
    - At Unity Bank Kachia Branch
    - From your savings account 
    - With a remaining balance of #1,236,329.91

All these details are data. Now imagine thousands of customers doing the same thing every day ‚Äî all of that becomes a **dataset**. 

Data is a set of recorded information - facts, figures, measurements or observations that describes the world around us. 
It can be numbers, words, images, clicks on a website, sensor readings

üîë Key Characteristics
1. **Raw Material**: Unprocessed e.g numbers, text, images etc
2. **Context-Dependent**: The same data can tell different stories e.g "30¬∞C" could mean *Hot"* for *London* but *"Cool"* for Nigeria
3. **Representation**: Can be *structured* (e.g tables) or *unstructured* (e.g email, social media posts) 

Think about all the ways you use data daily: navigating with maps, managing your health, getting song recommendations, or personalizing your social media feed etc. Data helps us make informed decisions, uncover trends and patterns, and solve complex problems. In business, using data can mean the difference between making a product that customers love or launching one that flops. For instance, Netflix uses data on viewing habits to suggest shows that keep you binge-watching üé¨üìä!

üìö key takeaway
    - **Data** is what you *Collect/Record*.
    - **Information** is what you *Understand*.
    - **Knowledge** is what you *Apply*.
    
>You can think of data as ingredients : ***Data***(flour,eggs, sugar, vegetable oil), then the result of what u made with these ingredients as ***Information***(Pan-cake) and finally the Recipe experts as ***Knowledge**(The Baker). 

### üß† Why Should You Care About Data Science?

With data flooding in from everywhere, companies need experts to make sense of it all ‚Äì that‚Äôs where Data Science comes in. Data science is the field that combines math, statistics, coding, and domain expertise to extract insights and build predictive models. Data scientists can analyze customer behavior, detect fraud, recommend products, predict stock prices, and so much more. It‚Äôs a role that helps shape strategies, innovate products, and, ultimately, drive a company‚Äôs success.

Data Science has been ranked as one of the most promising fields of the 21st century. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, demand for data scientists is expected to grow by 36% between 2021 and 2031, much faster than the average for all occupations.

### üõ†Ô∏è The Data Science Process Roadmap

The steps that data scientists typically follow. Each part of this process is relies on the preceding one to convert raw data into valuable insights.

`1. Problem Definition üïµÔ∏è`
we need to Understand the business or reseach problem we're trying to solve.
***Ask Questions Like***: What are we trying to predict/Understand? this guides the entire project.

`2. Data Collection üì•`
This involves gathering data from relevant sources.
Where does data comes from?
***Traditional Sources***: Surveys, Sensors, Business Transactions e.t.c
***Mordern Sources***: Social Media (e.g Tweets,Likes e.t.c), IoT Devices (e.g Smart watches, Thermostats e.t.c), Web Scraping (e.g Product Prices, News Articles e.t.c) and more.
For example, Uber collects location data to optimize routes. Without this initial data collection, you have nothing to analyze! How else do you think Spotify Wrapped is created?

`3. Data Cleaning(Data Wrangling) üßº`

Data cleaning is the process of removing duplicates, filling in missing values, and correcting errors. Imagine trying to analyze data with spelling errors or missing information ‚Äì it would be like trying to solve a puzzle with missing pieces! A good example of such case is a survey form with options like ‚ÄúN/A‚Äù, "na" or ‚ÄúOther‚Äù. This step ensures that responses make sense for analysis.

`4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) üîç`

Data scientists uses summary stats and visualizations like graphs and charts,to uncover patterns, anomalies, corelations, or insights. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, analysts observed infection trends through visual graphs, which helped governments make crucial health decisions.

`5. Model Building ü§ñ`

Data Scientists Splits data and Uses statistical methods to select algorithm(e.g regression, random forests). and machine learning algorithms, to train and validate models that can predict outcomes or classify information. For instance, Amazon uses models to recommend products you‚Äôre likely to buy based on your browsing history.

`6. Evaluation ‚úÖ`

No model is complete without testing! The evaluation step assesses how accurate or effective a model is. Imagine creating a global warming prediction model ‚Äì accuracy is crucial to ensure people can rely on it!

`7. Deployment & Monitoring üöÄ`

Finally, we put the model to work. But it doesn‚Äôt end there ‚Äì we need to track model performance over time to ensure the model continues to performs well with new data in the real world. For instance, a false transaction detection model in crypto must be continuously updated to stay ahead of new scam techniques.

*Data Science involves an ‚ö†Ô∏è***iterative process*** as we often loop back to earlier steps. For example Data scientists revisits Exploratory Data Analysis if a Model fails). Also Data scientists spends 80% of their time on Data preparations and 20% on Modelling, hence the üìä***80/20 Rule***. For Data Scientists - The best models must solve real world problems,, not just achieve high accuracy this theory is known as üß≠***Business Alighnment***.*

By the end of this course, you‚Äôll have hands-on experience with these steps and the knowledge to tackle real-world data challenges.
