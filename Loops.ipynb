    "# Python Loops: \n",
    "## Introduction to Loops\n",
    "Loops are programming constructs that **repeat** a block of code multiple times, allowing us to perform tasks efficiently without writing repetitive code. In Python, the two main loop types are **for loops** (which iterate over a sequence of items) and **while loops** (which repeat as long as a condition remains true). Use a *for loop* when you know the number of iterations in advance (for example, iterating through a list), and use a *while loop* when you want to repeat until a certain condition changes (such as waiting for user input).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **For loops** automatically traverse a sequence (like a list, string, or range) one item at a time. For example, `for fruit in [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]:` repeats for each fruit.\n",
    "* **While loops** execute as long as a given condition is `True`. You must manually update the loop condition; otherwise, the loop may run forever (an *infinite loop*).\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Off-by-one errors:** This happens when the loop runs one time too many or too few. For example, using `<=` instead of `<` can execute the loop one extra time. Always double-check loop boundaries.\n",
    "* **Forgetting to update loop variables:** In a `while` loop, forgetting to change the loop variable (e.g., missing `i += 1`) will cause an infinite loop. Make sure each loop makes progress toward ending.\n",
    "* **Logical errors in nested loops:** Remember that a `break` only exits the innermost loop. If you need to exit outer loops too, use flags or multiple breaks. Also watch indentation carefully: code inside the loop must be indented correctly.\n",
    "* **Indentation and block issues:** Python groups loop bodies by indentation. Ensure that only the intended lines are indented under the loop; otherwise, some code may not repeat as expected.\n",
