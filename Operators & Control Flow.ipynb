    "* In the first loop, when `i` is 4, `break` stops the loop, so it only prints 1, 2, 3.\n",
    "* In the second loop, when `i` is 3, `continue` skips the `print` for that iteration and moves to the next, so it prints all numbers except 3.\n",

    "## Tips, Common Mistakes, and Analogies\n",
    "* **Indentation:** Python uses indentation to group code. Always indent blocks (after `if`, `for`, etc.) consistently (usually 4 spaces). Forgetting or mis-aligning indentation is a very common error.\n",
    "* **Colons:** Remember the colon (`:`) after `if`, `for`, `while`, `elif`, `else`. Missing a colon is a syntax error.\n",
    "* **Equality vs Assignment:** Use `==` to compare values, and `=` to assign. For example, writing `if x = 5:` is wrong; you must write `if x == 5:` for comparison.\n",
    "* **Loop Variables:** In a `while` loop, update the loop variable so the loop can stop. For example, change `x = x + 1` or use a counter. Otherwise the loop may never end (infinite loop). This was noted as a common pitfall.\n",
    "* **`is` vs `==`:** For checking value equality, use `==`. The `is` operator checks for identical objects (useful mostly for things like `if var is None`).\n",
    "* **Operator Errors:** Division `/` vs floor division `//` can trip beginners. Also note that `%` has higher precedence than `*` and `/`. When in doubt, use parentheses.\n",
    "* **Analogy – If/Else:** Think of `if` as asking a yes/no question. If yes, do this; otherwise, try another question or do something else.\n",
    "* **Analogy – Loops:** A `for` loop is like telling the computer “for each item in my list, do the following.” A `while` loop is like “repeat this action until the condition changes.”\n",
    "\n",
    ">Always test small pieces of code and print intermediate results to see how they work. And when in doubt, print out variables inside loops or conditions to check what’s happening.\n",

    "## Practice Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "Try these small tasks to check your understanding. After each, think about what the code will do, then compare with the explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Arithmetic and Comparison:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   x = 8\n",
    "   y = 3\n",
    "   print(x % y)\n",
    "   print(x // y)\n",
    "   print(x > y)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Question:** What does this print? Explain each line.\n",
    "   **Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * `x % y` is `8 % 3`, the remainder when 8 is divided by 3. That is 2.\n",
    "   * `x // y` is `8 // 3`, the floor division (integer part), which is 2 as well (since 8/3 is 2.666, floored to 2).\n",
    "   * `x > y` checks if 8 is greater than 3, which is `True`.\n",
    "       (This tests arithmetic `%` and `//`, and the comparison `>`.)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Logical Operators:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   a = True\n",
    "   b = False\n",
    "   c = 5\n",
    "   print(a and b)\n",
    "   print(a or b)\n",
    "   print(not (c > 10))\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Question:** What is the output, and why?\n",
    "   **Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * `a and b` is `True and False`, which is `False` (both must be true for `and`).\n",
    "   * `a or b` is `True or False`, which is `True` (at least one is true).\n",
    "   * `c > 10` is `5 > 10`, which is `False`; then `not (False)` is `True`.\n",
    "     So the program prints:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   False\n",
    "   True\n",
    "   True\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **If/Else:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   num = 0\n",
    "   if num:\n",
    "       print(\"Non-zero\")\n",
    "   else:\n",
    "       print(\"Zero\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Question:** What will this print? (Hint: In Python, `if num:` checks truthiness.)\n",
    "   **Answer:**\n",
    "   In Python, `if num:` checks if `num` is nonzero (non-zero numbers are treated as True). Since `num` is 0, it is falsey, so the `else` branch runs. It prints:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Zero\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   (This shows that 0 is treated as False in conditions.)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **For Loop with Break:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   words = [\"go\", \"stop\", \"go\", \"wait\"]\n",
    "   for w in words:\n",
    "       if w == \"stop\":\n",
    "           break\n",
    "       print(w)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Question:** Which words are printed, and why?\n",
    "   **Answer:**\n",
    "   The loop iterates through `words`. It prints each word until it sees `\"stop\"`. When `w == \"stop\"`, it executes `break` and exits the loop immediately. So it prints:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   go\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   only the first element (`\"go\"`), then stops. (It doesn’t print `\"stop\"` or anything after, because of the break.)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **While Loop with Continue:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   i = 1\n",
    "   while i < 5:\n",
    "       i += 1\n",
    "       if i == 3:\n",
    "           continue\n",
    "       print(i)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Question:** What is the output? Step through each iteration.\n",
    "   **Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Initially `i = 1`. Check `i < 5` (1<5 True). Inside loop, `i` becomes 2. Then `if i == 3` is False (2≠3), so it prints `2`.\n",
    "   * Next loop: `i = 2` at start, `2 < 5` True. `i` becomes 3. Now `i == 3` is True, so `continue` runs: it skips the `print` and restarts the loop. Nothing printed this round.\n",
    "   * Next loop: `i = 3`, `3 < 5` True. `i` becomes 4. `i == 3` is False, print `4`.\n",
    "   * Next: `i = 4`, `4 < 5` True. `i` becomes 5. `i == 3` is False, print `5`.\n",
    "   * Next: `i = 5`, `5 < 5` is False, loop ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "   (3 is skipped because when `i` became 3, `continue` skipped that print.)\n",
    "\n",
