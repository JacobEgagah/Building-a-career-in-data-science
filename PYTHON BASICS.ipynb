    "Variables are fundamental building blocks in Python that allows you to store and manipulate data in your programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Is A Variable?üåü\n",
    "You can think of python variables as *\"Labelled Boxes or containers\"* that are used to store your data, Just like you can put fruits in a box and Label the box \"Fruits\", in python you assign a name(label) to hold/store value(data)\n",
    "You can give a variable a name, and inside it, you can store a piece of data like a number, text, or even a lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "The variable is simply a way to label and hold something so you can refer to it later.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, it stores information (data) that you might want to use or manipulate later in your code. For example, you might want to store your age, a name, or the price of a product.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key things to remember:\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable can hold different data types (numbers, text, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can change what's inside the variable, just like how a fruit box/container can be reused to store something else.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables help make your code easier to read and manage by letting you refer to data with names you choose.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variable Naming Rules\n",
    "- It must start a letter (a-z, A-Z) or and underscore (_).\n",
    "- It can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.\n",
    "- It cannot be a Python keyword (like \"if, for, while, else etc.)\n",
    "- It is case sensitive (age, AGE and Age are completely different Variables)\n",
    "Good variable namee are descriptive and follow conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "How to Create a Variable?\n",
    "In Python, creating (or defining) a variable is super simple! You just choose a name for your variable and use the = symbol to assign a value to it."
